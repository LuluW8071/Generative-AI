    "## Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector is like a list of numbers that represent something. Imagine you’re describing a point on a map using coordinates (like latitude and longitude). Similarly, a vector is a way to describe something with numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If you have a picture of a cat, a vector could be used to represent this cat by listing numbers that describe various features of the picture.\n",

    "## Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are a special kind of vector that helps computers understand complex things, like words or images, in a way that makes them easier to work with. Think of embeddings as a way to turn something complex into a list of numbers that a computer can easily understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "If you have the word \"apple,\" an embedding would turn it into a vector of numbers. This vector helps the computer understand the meaning of \"apple\" in relation to other words.\n",
