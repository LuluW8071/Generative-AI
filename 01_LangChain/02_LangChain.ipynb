(2014)\\nachieved in their work.\\n1 Introduction\\nMachine Translation (MT) is the task of translat-\\ning text without human assistance while preserv-\\ning the meaning of input text. The early approach\\nto machine translation relied heavily on hand-\\ncrafted translation rules and linguistic knowledge.\\nStarted in early around 1950s, unlike rule-based\\nmachine translation, Statistical machine transla-\\ntion (SMT) generated translations based on statis-\\ntical models whose parameters are derived from\\nthe analysis of bilingual text corpora (Koehn et al.,\\n2003). Though reliable, for SMT, it can be hard\\nto ﬁnd content for obscure languages and is less\\nsuitable for language pairs with big differences\\nin word order making the quality of translation\\nfar from satisfactory. With the progress in deep\\nlearning being applied to MT, in 2014, end-to-end\\nneural network translation model was proposed\\nby (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014)\\nwhere the term ”neural machine translation” wasformally used. Neural machine translation (NMT)\\nis the newest method of MT that uses a single\\nlarge neural network to model the entire transla-\\ntion process, freeing the need for excessive fea-\\nture engineering. Through the rapid research and\\nbreakthroughs, end-to-end neural machine trans-\\nlation has gained remarkable performances (Shi\\net al., 2021; Bahdanau et al., 2014) and have be-\\ncome mainstream approach to MT.\\n2 Related Work\\nEarly problem of NMT was often the poor trans-\\nlation for long sentences (Sutskever et al., 2014)\\nwhich can be attributed to the ﬁxed-length of\\nsource encoding in conventional encoder-decoder\\nas suggested by Cho et al. (2014a) for which the\\nconcept of attention to NMT was introduced by\\nBahdanau et al. (2014) to avoid keeping a ﬁxed\\nsource side representation.\\nAs compared to separately tuned components in\\nSMT, newly emerging Neural Machine translation\\nradically departures from previous machine learn-\\ning approaches as the training of NMT is end-to-\\nend which has signiﬁcantly improved translation\\nquality across 30 different languages (Junczys-\\nDowmunt et al., 2016). NMT model can be attrac-\\ntive for various reason one being scalability issue,\\nwhether it be memory requirements or computa-\\ntional speed. Another being able to train all the\\ncharacter embedding as each characters frequently\\noccurs in the training corpus.\\nMost neural machine translation models pro-\\nposed use encoder-decoder where a neural net-\\nwork reads and encodes a source sentence into\\na ﬁxed-length vector and a decoder then outputs\\na translation from the encoded vector, where in\\nmost of the cases the encoder and decoder are\\nmainly implemented as RNNs, CNNs or self-\\nattention network (Wu et al., 2018).

After the initial proposal by\\n(Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014),\\nmuch work has been done on the sequence-to-\\nsequence neural machine translation model rang-\\ning from new attention mechanism (Luong et al.,\\n2015) to working on the problem of out-of-\\nvocabulary words (Jean et al., 2015) for which se-\\nquential RNNs are used both for encoding source\\nsentences and generating target translation.\\nWe draw our inspiration for machine transla-\\ntion with attention from Bahdanau et al. (2014).\\nWe have chosen to base our project on this paper\\nas attention mechanism has been widely used as\\nbaseline and is thoroughly studied among the NLP\\ncommunity.\\n3 Model\\nMachine Translation is equivalent to maximizing a\\nconditional probability of a target sentence given\\nthe source sentence. In Neural Machine Trans-\\nlation, we parameterize it to maximise the condi-\\ntional probability. The approach used by Cho et al.\\n(2014b) was to encode the source sentence into\\na ﬁxed-length vector, which becomes difﬁcult to\\ncompress all the necessary information into a ﬁxed\\nlength vector, which makes it difﬁcult for the Neu-\\nral Network to handle long sentences, and thus the\\nperformance of the encoder-decoder drops as the\\nlength of the sentences increases. So we use the\\nmodel proposed by Bahdanau et al. (2014), where\\nit does not encode the input sentence into a ﬁxed-\\nlength vector, rather than it simply encodes the in-\\nput sentence into sequence of vectors, and while\\ndecoding the translation, it select subset of vectors\\nfrom the using attention mechanism. And Bah-\\ndanau et al. (2014) showed that encoder decoder\\nmodel with attention mechanism cope better with\\nlong sentences. In the next section, we will ﬁrst\\ngive a brief introduction on encoder-decoder, the\\nRNN, and one of its type, GRU, the one we used\\nin our model and ﬁnally the attention mechanism.\\n3.1 Encoder-Decoder\\nEncoder-Decoder, ﬁrst proposed by Cho et al.\\n(2014b), basically consists of 2 parts, the encoder\\nand the decoder. Encoder codes the sequence\\nof input sentence into dense vector representa-\\ntion, and then decoder takes in the encoded sen-\\ntence and decode the representation into anothersequences of words. They are trained to maximize\\nthe conditional probability of the output sentence,\\ngiven the input sentence.\\nRNN is necessary when we need to maintain the\\nword order in a sentence. This is not handled by\\nbags of words model or other statistical models. In\\naddition to input, xiand output ˆyi, we also have a\\nstate vector, ai, which is initialized with vectors of\\nzeros.iwould be the ithtimestep In the ﬁrst layer\\nof RNN, the input and state vector is fed into the\\nrecurrent unit, the recurent unit may look like1:\\nat=f(Waaat−1+Waxxi),\\nand,\\nˆyt=g(Wyaat)\\nwhere, t is the time step, Waais the weights be-\\ntween two hidden layer, Waxis the weight be-\\ntween input and hidden layer, and Wyais the\\nweight between hidden and the output layer, and\\nfcan betanh orRelu activation function, and g\\ncan besigmoid orsoftmax activation function.\\nAfter feeding the input to rnn unit, it returns a new\\nstate vector in the next time step. This new state\\nvector will be mapped to the output vector using\\nsome function. This output vector can be used as\\na prediction. The new state vector is cached and is\\npassed across the next unit of the RNN, along with\\nthe input in order for it to return the next state vec-\\ntor. This happens recursively for all the input ele-\\nments. So, when the model is reading the second\\nword, instead of just predicting output using only\\nthe second word, it also gets information from the\\nprevious time step (ﬁrst word) in terms of the state\\nvector.\\nOne of the problem of RNN is that it runs into\\nthe problem of Vaishing gradient, ﬁrst described\\nby Hochreiter (1998). This happens when we have\\na very long sentence, which tends to have long\\nterm dependencies. That means a word at the end'),\n",

The gradients diminishes in the backpropa-\\ngation step and not able to reach the earlier units.\\nGenerally, RNN has local inﬂuences where a word\\nis mainly inﬂuenced by words closed to it.

The state vector in simple RNN can\\nbe considered as a memory, where the memory ac-\\ncess was not controlled. At each step, the entire\\nmemory state was read and updated. But in GRU\\nand LSTM, we use a gating mechanism to control\\nthe memory. Since, we used GRU in our model,\\nso we will only describe GRU here.\\nIn GRU, (Chung et al., 2014; Rana, 2016), the\\nactivationhj\\ntis a linear interpolation between the\\nprevious activation hj\\nt−1and the candidate ativa-\\ntion˜hj\\nt:\\nhj\\nt= (1−zj\\nt)hj\\nt−1+zj\\nt˜hj\\nt\\nwhere,zj\\ntis the update gate, that decides how\\nmuch GRU units updates its activation [See Fig.\\n1].

When a reset gate at speciﬁc\\ntime, t is set to 0, i.e. rj\\nt== 0 , which makes the\\nGRU to forget the past, i.e. forget the previousstate vectors. This is considered same as reading\\nthe ﬁrst word of the input sentence. And ﬁnally,\\nwe can compute the reset gate by :\\nrj\\nt=σ(Wrxt+Urht−1)j.\\nOne of the weakness of RNN is that it only uses\\ninformation that is earlier in the sequence to make\\npredictions but not the information which are later\\nin the sequence. When predicting the output at\\ntime step i, it does not use the word at time step i+1\\nor i+2 or any other words in the later time step. So,\\nit would be useful to know not just the information\\nfrom the words from the previous time step but\\nalso the information from the later time steps.\\nSo, we use Bidirectional RNN, ﬁrst proposed\\nby (Schuster and Paliwal, 1997). From a point\\nin time, it takes information from both the ear-\\nlier and later time step in the sequence. The\\nFirst RNN, which we called forward RNN,− →fis\\nfed the input sequence as it is. And the second\\nRNN, which is also called backward RNN,← −f\\nis fed the input sequence in reverse order. This\\ngives two separate state vectors – a forward state\\nvector,− →hT\\nj, and a backward state vector← −hT\\nj.\\n− →hT\\njwould be a sequence of forward hidden state\\nvectors, (− →h1,...,− →hTx), and similarly, backward\\nstate vector← −hT\\njwould be a sequence of backward\\nhidden state vector, (← −h1,...,← −hTx). And the out-\\nput at a speciﬁc timestep is accounted by the con-\\ncatenation of output of two RNN’s, concatenating− →hjand← −hj, i.e.hj= [− →hT\\nj,← −hT\\nj].

The\\nencoder takes in the input sentence and converts\\nthem into a vector representation\\nThe encoder can be an RNN (Cho et al., 2014b)\\nor LSTM unit (Sutskever et al., 2014). They pro-\\ncesses the input sentence, pass it through RNN or\\nLSTM, and when it encounters the end of sen-\\ntence, then the hidden state, that captured all the\\nrelevant information passes it to the decoder. Then\\nthis information is used to predict the translations\\nin the decoder, which can be RNN or LSTM, until\\nit predicts the end of the sentence token. The hid-\\nden state needs to remember every word from the\\ninput sentence. So that is why this model tends to\\nwork for short sentences and not long sentences.\\nEven though if we used LSTM or GRU, which\\ntends to remember the words that occured very\\nearly in the sequence, it will still not be able to\\nlearn the alignment between the source word and\\nthe target word. They often forget the initial part\\nof the sentence once they are processed in the en-\\ncoder. That is why we use an alignment mecha-\\nnism called attention. They help to memorize this\\ninformation for longer sentences. But we need to\\nlearn this alignment. It can vary from language to\\nlanguage.3.2 Attention\\nIn this section, we will speciﬁcally deﬁne the\\nalignment mechanism, [See Figure 2] that we used\\nin our model. In RNN Encoder-Decoder model\\n(Sutskever et al., 2014), we faced with the bottle-\\nneck problem, where the complete sequence of in-\\nformation of the source sentence, must be captured\\nby one single vector, i.e. the last hidden unit of the\\nencoder RNN is used as a context vector for the\\ndecoder, which becomes difﬁcult for the decoder\\nto summarise large input sequence at once. This\\nalso poses a problem where the encoder is not able\\nto memorize the words coming at the beginning\\nof the sentences, which leads to poor translation\\nof the source sentence. The Attention mechanism\\njust addresses this issue, by retaining and utilising\\nall the hidden state of the input sentence during the\\ndecoding phase.\\nDuring the decoding phase, the model creates\\nan alignment between each time step of the de-\\ncoder output and all of the encoder hidden state.\\nWe need to learn this alignment. Each output of\\nthe decoder can selectively pick out speciﬁc ele-\\nments from the sequence to produce the output.\\nSo, this allows the model to focus and pay more\\n”Attention” to the relevant part of the input se-\\nquence.\\nThe ﬁrst attention model was proposed by Bah-\\ndanau et al. (2014), there are several other types of\\nattention proposed, such as the one by Luong et al.'),\n",

It tries to preserve\\nthe meaning of the whole sentence, and it does not\\nblindly takes the word from the reference, it tries\\nto generalize.\\nRefer to Table 4 at the end of the paper for\\nmore translations from Spanish to English using\\nEncoder Decoder model with Attention Mecha-\\nnism.\\n7 Discussion\\nAfter trying to achieve the result similar to what\\nwas presented in the paper, we are satisﬁed with\\nour result though there is much that can be im-\\nproved. Limitation caused by the hardware held\\nus back from achieving better results. We used the\\nserver provided by the university and as a backup\\nused google colab for our work, so we had to be\\nwary of the maintenance schedule happening in\\nthe server and the limitation of 24 hrs of work-\\ntime on google colab, which otherwise could in-\\nterrupt while we were training our model. So,\\nto overcome these challenges we decided to use\\n1M sentences from each form Spanish and English\\ndataset, and reduce the parameters for encoder-\\ndecoder.\\nWe also faced problem with length of the vo-\\ncabulary size of English and Spanish sentences,\\nwhere the vocabulary size of the English sen-\\ntence were the output dimension, and vocabularysize of Spanish sentence were input dimensions of\\nour model. This leads to increase in number of\\ntrainable parameters, the decoding complexity in-\\ncreases with number of target words (vocabulary\\nsize of the English), where this problem has been\\naddressed by Jean et al. (2015).\\n8 Conclusion\\nThe approach proposed by Cho et al. (2014b) was\\nto encode the whole sentence into ﬁxed length vec-\\ntor, and this becomes problematic when dealing\\nwith long sentences. We extend this basic encoder-\\ndecoder model by an Attention mechanism (Bah-\\ndanau et al., 2014), where the model searches for\\nthe input word computed from the encoder, which\\nbest align with the target word, when generat-\\ning each target word. This frees the model from\\nhaving to encode the source sentence into a ﬁxed\\nlength vector, only rely on the information rele-\\nvant for generating each target word. We com-\\npared our model for Spanish to English translation\\nwith both of these approaches, and found that our\\nmodel works better than the encoder-decoder ap-\\nproach (Cho et al., 2014b), and have slightly lower\\nresults than the architecture with Attention mech-\\nanism, (Bahdanau et al., 2014). We also observed\\nthat the model tries to align the target word with\\nthe relevant word from the translated sentence.\\nIn the future work, there are several things we\\ncan try. We can train our model on much larger\\ndataset, with a better hardware and with differ-\\nent attention models. We can also focus on how\\nto handle the stop words, punctuation, as we can\\nsee on Table 2 and Table 3, which accounts for\\nthe highest word count, and also to handle the un-\\nknown words, which does not appear in the train-\\ning data, but in the test data.\\nReferences\\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua\\nBengio.
